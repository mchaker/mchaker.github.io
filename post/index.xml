      <title>Porting a Verizon My Numbers Number to a full Verizon line</title>

      <description>Note: This assumes that you have a valid destination for the number porting (either a separate phone, or an eSIM phone like a recent iPhone).
Backstory/context The call box for an apartment I lived in only accepted destination/resident numbers starting with certain area codes.
My phone number did not meet that requirement, so I picked up a temporary second line from Verizon&amp;rsquo;s My Numbers app. That way, I could just use one phone, instead of buying a separate phone just to answer the door.</description>

      <description>Thank you to mikehanley from the Comcast Business Support Community Forums for the dhcpv6-pd commands.
Setting up IPv6 on a Comcast Business account is not straightforward if you are not using Comcast&amp;rsquo;s combined modem-router.
If you are using a UniFi Security Gateway ( SKU: USG), the following steps are necessary to get IPv6 working:
Assumptions:
 Comcast is providing you a /56 subnet for your IPv6 allocation You are using the UniFi web interface to manage your USG through a Cloud Key or Controller installation eth0 is your WAN interface  The interactive command-line route  In Settings &amp;gt; Networks &amp;gt; WAN, set the WAN interface to DHCPv6 with Prefix Delegation Size to 59 ( why 59 instead of 56) Save the new WAN network settings and wait for the USG to provision.</description>

      <description>Attempting to install ESXi on an Intel J1900 results in an error. The boot process freezes on:
 Relocating modules and starting up the kernel&amp;hellip;
 The fix can be found at: an archive of the original blog post
In short,
 At the ESXi boot screen, press Shift+O to open the boot options prompt. In the boot options line that appears, add the following after a space at the end of the line: ignoreHeadless=TRUE.</description>

      <title>Comcast Business IPv6 Prefix Notes</title>

      <description>original post by John Burwell can be found here
Here are my notes from this weekend&amp;rsquo;s IPv6 prefix exhaustion experiment.
Comcast delegates to my router a /59 prefix, instead of a /60. This is unexpected, but it&amp;rsquo;s okay, because one /59 is two /60s. A two-fer.
On the one hand, if you have only one router, this is a limitation; out of the /56 allocated to your account, there are 8 /59s, with only the two /60s per /59.</description>

      <description>link to original stack overflow post
First, run the following to establish your extended bash history file:
cat ~/.bash_history &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ~/.bash_history_extended I then added the following to my .bashrc:
1 2 3 4  export HISTFILESIZE= export HISTSIZE= export HISTFILE=~/.bash_history_extended PROMPT_COMMAND=&amp;#34;history -a; $PROMPT_COMMAND&amp;#34;   Remember to run source ~/.bashrc in any running shells/terminal windows to get the latest bash history config established.</description>
