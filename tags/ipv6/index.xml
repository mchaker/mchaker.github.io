      <description>Thank you to mikehanley from the Comcast Business Support Community Forums for the dhcpv6-pd commands.
Setting up IPv6 on a Comcast Business account is not straightforward if you are not using Comcast&amp;rsquo;s combined modem-router.
If you are using a UniFi Security Gateway ( SKU: USG), the following steps are necessary to get IPv6 working:
Assumptions:
 Comcast is providing you a /56 subnet for your IPv6 allocation You are using the UniFi web interface to manage your USG through a Cloud Key or Controller installation eth0 is your WAN interface  The interactive command-line route  In Settings &amp;gt; Networks &amp;gt; WAN, set the WAN interface to DHCPv6 with Prefix Delegation Size to 59 ( why 59 instead of 56) Save the new WAN network settings and wait for the USG to provision.</description>

Here are my notes from this weekend&amp;rsquo;s IPv6 prefix exhaustion experiment.
Comcast delegates to my router a /59 prefix, instead of a /60. This is unexpected, but it&amp;rsquo;s okay, because one /59 is two /60s. A two-fer.
On the one hand, if you have only one router, this is a limitation; out of the /56 allocated to your account, there are 8 /59s, with only the two /60s per /59.</description>
